# Next a very loooong running test, but one which successfully condenses the 2MB
# original file pair into a 26kB bsdiff.  The bsdiff computation alone (ie:
# non-valgrind'd) takes ~20minutes on a decent build machine.  Running it
# through valgrind takes many many hours to run to completion.  Therefore leave
# filepair #14 as one for only occasional use in long-running regression
# testing.  The other file pairs can be check quickly enough that they can be
# used in a regression test run at every check-in of code changes to the bsdiff
# implementation.
